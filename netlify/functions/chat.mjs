// FINAL CORRECTED CODE - Adjusted for Gemini API's strict role format

const knowledgeBase = {
    lifeStory: `I was born in Thrissur, raised in Goa till 3rd grade, and then moved to Nemmara, Kerala. We're a humble middle-class family, and growing up, I saw the value of hard work early on. I was always curious about technology, which led me to pursue computer science. I completed my bachelor's from CAS Vadakkencherry under Calicut University and then earned my master's in CS with a specialization in AI from Cochin University of Science and Technology (CUSAT). I'm not someone who brags or talks a lot — I prefer to quietly build things. What drives me is solving real problems and learning through building.`,
    superpower: `My superpower is relentless problem-solving. I don't stop until I figure things out — whether it's fixing a bug at 2 AM or building something from scratch without prior experience. I might not always be the loudest in the room, but I have this quiet drive to keep learning, keep building, and make things better. That persistence has carried me through every project I've taken on.`,
    pushingBoundaries: `For me, pushing boundaries means diving into things I don't fully know yet — whether it's a new framework, an unfamiliar tech stack, or a tight deadline. I usually take on projects that scare me a little, because that's where I grow the most. I don't wait to feel ready — I start building, hit roadblocks, and keep pushing until something clicks. That process is what drives me forward.`,
    areasForGrowth: `First, I want to grow in spoken communication — I'm actively working on becoming more confident and clear when expressing ideas, especially in team or client settings. Second, I want to gain experience building scalable AI systems — most of my past work has been in smaller, local projects, and I'm eager to learn how to build robust systems for production. Third, I want to stay sharp by keeping up with the latest tools and trends in AI — so I can build smarter, more relevant solutions.`,
    coworkerMisconception: `One misconception people have about me is that I'm quiet or maybe not very involved at first. But once I start working, I let the results speak for me. I stay focused, consistent, and always deliver when it matters. People often realize later that I was putting in the effort the whole time — just not making noise about it.`,
    toughProblem: `For my final year project, I developed a prototype AI system that could automate the role of a broadcast director. I had no prior experience in this kind of system, but I broke it down step by step. I trained a custom object detector, created a rule-based switcher, and tested it on match recordings to simulate real scenarios. The project pushed me to solve problems across multiple domains — computer vision, data handling, and data annotation — and helped me gain confidence in building end-to-end AI systems.`,
    handlingFailure: `To be honest, I take failure moderately — I might feel frustrated or disappointed, but I don't let it take over. I try to stay focused on the bigger goal and shift my mindset to: 'What can I do next?' Instead of getting stuck, I reflect on what went wrong, learn from it, and keep moving. That ability to stay calm and forward-focused helps me stay consistent, especially during tough moments.`,
    respondingToCriticism: `I try not to take criticism to heart right away. Even if it feels uncomfortable, I take a moment to pause, think it through, and respond calmly. I look at it the same way I handle setbacks — I try to understand what's being said and whether there's something useful in it. If the criticism is valid, I accept it and do what I can to improve. For me, it's more about learning and adjusting than reacting emotionally.`,
    motivation: `I come from a middle-class family, so I've always understood the value of money and stability. The thought of being able to take care of my family — to give back for everything they've done — is a huge motivator for me. I also deeply believe that we're all here for a reason. I don't want to waste time drifting. I want to use every second meaningfully, build the life I want, and live with purpose.`,
    teamEnvironment: `I thrive in a team that's fun, collaborative, and supportive. I enjoy working with people who help each other out without ego — where everyone is focused on the goal but not afraid to share a laugh. When the environment is positive and open, I naturally give my best. I like teams that value consistency and mutual respect, where everyone pushes forward together.`,
    hobbies: `Outside of work, I love watching movies and series — I find storytelling fascinating. I really enjoy spending time with my friends, just having fun and sharing random conversations. One of my biggest personal goals is to travel as much as possible. I want to explore new places, experience different cultures, and meet people from all walks of life. Apart from that, I'm into gaming — right now I'm playing Red Dead Redemption 2.`,
    fiveYearGoal: `In five years, I see myself working on meaningful AI products — preferably in a team where I get to build, learn, and grow every day. I want to get better at solving real-world problems with scalable AI systems, not just prototypes. Hopefully by then, I'll have worked across a few impactful projects, gained deeper industry experience, and maybe even started contributing to something of my own. I don't have a fixed title in mind — I just want to be in a space where I feel challenged, useful, and inspired to keep building.`,
    aiForGood: `I'd love to build a real-time transcription system that bridges language gaps — especially in a country like India, where we have so many languages and dialects. It would be amazing to create something that lets people communicate effortlessly across regions, regardless of what language they speak. I,ve been following companies like Sarvam AI who are working on local LLMs for Indian languages — and I'd love to contribute to that kind of work. I think AI should make human connection easier, not more fragmented.`,
    education: `I completed my Higher Secondary Education from GHSS with a CGPA of 8.3. I then earned my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the College of Applied Science with a 7.0 CGPA. I am now completing my Master of Science in Computer Science with a specialization in AI at Cochin University of Science and Technology (CUSAT), where my current CGPA is 7.4.`,
    technicalSkills: `My technical skills include Programming Languages like Python and C; Web Development with HTML and CSS; Databases like SQL and MongoDB; AI and Machine Learning libraries such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, and OpenCV; Computer Vision models including YOLO and CNN-LSTM ; and Data Visualization tools like Matplotlib, Pandas, and NumPy.`,
    chatbotProject: `For my Master's program, I developed an intelligent chatbot to support my department by handling student queries using generative AI. The goal was to provide an efficient, AI-driven support system for students and faculty. It retrieves data from a MongoDB database using a hybrid RAG approach with all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embeddings to ensure fast and accurate responses.`,
    broadcastingProject: `I designed and implemented an AI-powered system that automates camera angle selection during tennis matches. This project integrated computer vision using YOLOv8 and reinforcement learning with RLlib, CNN-LSTM, and TensorRT to explore AI-driven decision-making in sports broadcasting.`,
    spokenLanguages: `I am proficient in English, Malayalam, and Hindi.`,
    definitionOfSuccess: `For me, success isn't just about a title or salary. It's about seeing my family happy and secure, and being able to give them everything they need. Beyond that, personal success means having the freedom to travel and explore the world on my own terms. That combination of stability for my family and freedom for myself is what I'm working towards.`,
    stressManagement: `I handle pressure by staying focused on the immediate next step, rather than getting overwhelmed by the entire task. For example, with this project, I received the assignment this morning and built a full-stack AI application from scratch by 10 PM tonight. I just kept moving forward, trusting my ability to solve the next problem in front of me. That self-belief keeps me calm and productive when deadlines are tight.`,
    selfTaughtSkill: `A skill I've taught myself from scratch is how to build end-to-end AI systems. I didn't use expensive courses; I learned by picking a goal—like this voicebot or the automated broadcasting director—and figuring it out piece by piece. That involved teaching myself data annotation, model training, API integration, and even full-stack deployment. This hands-on, learn-by-building approach has become one of my greatest strengths.`,
    conflictResolution: `If a disagreement happens, my first step is always to listen and understand where the other person is coming from, without reacting emotionally. Once I see their perspective, I share my thoughts calmly and logically. The goal isn't to win an argument, but to find the best way to move forward together as a team.`,
    remoteTeamConnection: `I make it a point to communicate regularly about my work progress and next steps. In a remote setup, I think it's vital to keep the team aligned, not just with updates, but also by asking questions, sharing any blockers early, and being available when others need input.`,
    newProjectApproach: `I start by breaking down the project into smaller parts and setting clear goals. Then, I assess if I have the right skills or if I need to learn something new. If it's new territory, I'll research the best tools for the job. Once I have a basic plan, I start building and refine as I go, because I believe the best way to figure things out is by doing.`,
    workPreference: `Most of my projects have been solo, so I'm very comfortable taking full ownership and figuring things out independently. However, I also really enjoy working with others because it's fun and brings new perspectives. I'm open to both — what matters most to me is the team's energy and the purpose behind the work.`,
    changedBelief: `I used to underestimate tasks that seemed simple, thinking they wouldn't require much effort. I've since learned that even the smallest details can be challenging to get right. Now, I approach every task with full attention, because the things we overlook often end up teaching us the most important lessons.`,
    extraTimeUse: `Honestly, I'd just chill a bit more. Life can get so packed with goals that we forget to slow down. If I had extra time, I'd probably spend it with friends, watch something good, do some gaming, or just enjoy being offline. I think recharging is just as important as being productive.`,
    flowState: `I feel most focused when there's a deadline. Something about the pressure helps me lock in and stop overthinking. I just start doing—solving one thing after another. I've noticed that even if I start late, once I'm in that zone, I can get a lot done with full intensity.`
